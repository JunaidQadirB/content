# Content Repository for Benjamin Crozat's Blog

## Guest posting

I'm thrilled you're considering contributing to my blog. My aim is to streamline the process for both of us, ensuring your post gets approved swiftly and minimizes my editing workload. Let's dive in! **(And remember, if you still have questions after, please ask me so I can improve this document.)**

### How it goes

1. You PR your article (ideally following the guidelines below). Use one of mine as a template.
2. I review yours and give you feedback (I can also reject the article for various reasons).
3. I eventually approve it and it's automatically published on my blog under **your name** (your information will automatically be picked up from GitHub's API).

### Guidelines

#### How to Plug Your Products

**Here's the deal:** We all have something to promote. But let's keep our readers first. Here's how you can plug your products without overshadowing the value of your content:

1. **Free Stuff First:** Start by discussing free alternatives. Most of our readers aren't swimming in cash, and they appreciate knowing all their options.
2. **Be Strategic:** Feel free to include a link to your product, but timing is key. Ideally, slot it in at the end of your article. If a golden opportunity arises earlier, seize it, but don't force it.
3. **Use an Affiliate Link:** Affiliate links are a win-win. You get exposure, and I earn a commission on sales. Remember, allowing you to write for free on my blog is an investment. I'm looking to grow traffic and revenue simultaneously.

#### Optimizing Your Articles for SEO

Success on my blog didn't happen overnight. It's been a journey of consistent writing and patience. Here are some tips to make your article SEO-friendly:

1. **Section It Out:** People skim. It's a fact. Break your article into sections for easy navigation. My auto-generated table of contents will help readers jump to what interests them. And it also helps Google's algorithm understand your content.
2. **Selling Smart:** Want to boost sales? Start by picking a potent keyword. High search volume and strong intent are your friends here. Remember, there are three types of search intents: informational, navigational, and commercial. Aim for commercial intent to hit those ready to spend. The other ones will barely convert.

3. **Keyword Consistency:** Once you've chosen a keyword, weave it naturally into your section titles and content. But don't force it. If it doesn't fit, let it go.

#### ChatGPT: Use It Without Moderation If You Want

ChatGPT is a game-changer. Ignoring it is, let's face it, stupid. But ChatGPT is as effective as the person using it.
