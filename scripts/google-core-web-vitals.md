Hi! My name is Benjamin Crozat. You are listening to the AI-generated audio version of my article titled: "Core web vitals aren't that important for Google."

In the bustling world of SEO and website optimization, we hear a lot about core web vitals. The term has been picked up and echoed across articles and discussions, often leading many developers and content creators to fixate on these metrics introduced by Google. These metrics are designed to measure how a user experiences a web page, looking closely at things like how fast it loads, how quickly it responds to interactions, and how stable the content appears on the screen.

But let's take a step back and think: Are core web vitals the be-all and end-all for Google rankings, or is there a bigger picture we're missing?

Interestingly, while these vitals are relevant and they do play a role in how Google understands the user experience on your website, they're just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Imagine your website is like a gem with many facets, each facet like content, design, and usability, equally essential to its overall brilliance.

Having excellent core web vitals can contribute to better user experiences, which in turn, can positively affect certain metrics that Google takes into consideration. However, these aren't the magic lever for achieving SEO stardom. For instance, my personal blog's core web vitals scores aren't world record-breaking, yet it still attracts around 30,000 clicks per month from Google.

But let's turn our attention to what truly is a game-changer in this space: crawlability. How well can Google's bots sift through and index your site? This factor is critical because if Google has trouble navigating your content, great core web vitals scores will hardly make a dent in your SEO performance.

So what can developers do to improve a website's crawlability? They need to ensure their site structure is straightforward, make sure content is readily available and not tangled in complex JavaScript or dependent on user-driven events, and perhaps consider using a sitemap for larger sites with numerous pages.

On top of that, developers should frequently review their robots.txt files and meta robots tags, keeping an eye out for configurations that might hinder Google from accessing certain pages.

In essence, optimal core web vitals and effective site crawlability go hand in hand. You don't have to choose one over the other. Instead, see them as complementary. While you work on those web vitals to boost the user experience, don't let the nuts and bolts of SEO—like making your site understandable and navigable to Google—fall by the wayside.

Summing it up, core web vitals have their place in the grand scheme of your website's performance, but they should not obscure the significance of SEO basics such as crawlability. It's by striking a balance between the two, fine-tuning both your website's user experience, and its accessibility to search engines, that you craft a durable and effective SEO strategy.

So folks, if you're interested in diving deeper and getting insights from a reputable source, Google Search Central's podcast has discussed this precise topic. Now, that's a conversation worth tuning into.
