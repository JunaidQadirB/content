## Introduction

PHP is an open-source project. Knowing what's going on for the next version only takes a minute of research. For instance, this page lists all the [accepted RFCs for different versions of PHP](https://wiki.php.net/rfc).

## When will PHP 8.4 be released?

**PHP 8.4 will probably be released some time at the end of 2024.** For now, though, take it with a grain of salt, nothing official has been said.

## How to install and test PHP 8.4?

To this day, there is no easy way to install PHP 8.4. My recommendation is that you compile it from its source code.

## What's new in PHP 8.4

For now, we don't have any accepted RFC for PHP 8.4. All we can see is [this draft](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_4) related to features that should be deprecated in PHP 8.4 and removed in PHP 9.0.
