## Introduction

This article is targeted at people like me, who don't have any skill related to the world of AI.

I won't go into much details, as my comprehension of this topic is extremely limited. (I'm learning fast, though.)

I just want to demystify GPT and give you a high-level understanding of large language models (or LLMs), so you can use them more effectively in your next project or when "chatting" with them (through ChatGPT for instance).

## How does GPT work?

Here's a simplified way to see it: **At the root of GPT is a word prediction algorithm (named "Transformer") that is based on the patterns it notices from its training data.**

**GPT does not understand what you say or what it says**, despite showing clear signs of intelligence. 

**All it sees** from the huge amount of content it's been trained on or what you prompted it with **are numbers**. They're also called "tokens."

## How can GPT feel so smart?

**GPT has been trained with such an astronomical amount of data that, at some point, it started to show signs of (artificial) intelligence.**

Imagine something that's been forced to digest a huge amount of knowledge and can't help but become smarter thanks to it.

However, don't try to think of it as a human being or even a particularly smart animal. You'll have a hard time making sense of this.

GPT won't learn anything else beyond its training data. It doesn't work like our brains.

## Why is GPT often referred to as a "model?"

**GPT is called a model because it has been trained to model the statistical patterns of language.**

More specifically, it has learned to predict the probability of a word given the previous one in a sentence, which allows it to generate text that is similar to what humans do.

## Is GPT smart enough to be sentient?

For now, **GPT is just a language model that gives the illusion of intelligence and is not sentient.** It isn't aware of itself and doesn't have desires.

## Whatâ€™s the difference between GPT and ChatGPT?

**ChatGPT is just a web application that wraps the GPT model into a user-friendly interface** so anybody can interact with it.

## Could GPT dominate humanity at some point?

**AI could change humanity for the better.**

But some people could use it for harmful matters.

Experts even say it's possible that AI could try to control humanity at some point, even if we can't imagine its motives yet. Currently, though, GPT wouldn't be able to.
