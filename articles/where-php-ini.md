Your *php.ini* file is the control center for setting up your environment. Here are straightforward methods to locate this file.

## phpinfo() tells you where your php.ini file is

The quickest path any PHP developer discovers first is through the `phpinfo()` function. Itâ€™s a simple process:

- Create a new project with a PHP file named *index.php*.
- Add the following code:
```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```
- Open the project in your web browser.

The "Loaded Configuration File" section will indicate where the active php.ini file is.

## The command line can also find where you php.ini file is

For those who favor the command line, PHP provides a straightforward command:
1. Open the terminal.
2. Type `php --ini` and execute it.
3. The terminal will display the path to the *php.ini* file.
