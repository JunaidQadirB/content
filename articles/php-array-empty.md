## Introduction

To ensure that a PHP array is empty, you can use any of the following methods:

1. Use the `empty()` function to check if the array is empty. The function will return a boolean value (`true` or `false`).
2. Use the `count()` (or `sizeof()`) function to count the number of elements in the array and check if it's equal to zero. `count()` can even count the numbers of entries inside a multidimensional array.
3. Use the not operator (`!`). If the array does hold any value, the not operator will return `true`.

You can stop there, or we can dive deeper and see in detail how these ways to check for empty arrays work.

## The `empty()` function

The `empty()` function determines if an array is empty or not. It simply returns `true` or `false` depending on the content of it.

This is my favorite way to check if an array is empty in PHP.

```php
$foo = [];

if (empty($foo)) { // true
    //
}

$bar = ['Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz'];

if (empty($bar)) { // false
    //
}
```

## The `count()` function

The `count()` function counts the number of entries in an array and returns it as an integer.

You can even use it with [Countable](https://www.php.net/manual/en/class.countable.php) objects.

```php
echo count(['Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz']);
```

For multidimensional arrays, there's a second parameter for which you can use the `COUNT_RECURSIVE` constant to recursively count the numbers of items.

```php
$array = [
    'Foo' => [
        'Bar' => ['Baz'],
    ],
];

// 3
$count = count($array, COUNT_RECURSIVE);

// If $count is greater than zero.
if ($count > 0) {
    // The array is not empty.
} else {
	  // The array is empty.
}
```

## The `sizeof()` function

`sizeof()` is an alias of count() and can be used on arrays in the same way. [PHP actually has a lot of aliases for various functions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/aliases.php).

There's nothing to add, [you already know how to use it](#the-count-function):

```php
echo sizeof(['Foo', 'Bar', 'Baz']);
```

## The not (`!`) operator

This one is simple. You are probably used to the not (`!`) operator. I had no clue it could check for empty arrays. But here I am, after more than 15 years of PHP, learning yet another basic thing. ðŸ˜…

```php
$foo = [];

if (! $foo) {
    echo '$foo is empty.';
}
```
