## Introduction

If you are in a hurry, let me tell you right now my opinion: **Filament is better in almost all cases.**

Here’s why:
- It’s free and open source.
- It’s built on more solid and simpler foundations: Livewire instead of Vue.js, which also requires maintainers to build an API and plugin developers to write JavaScript.
- It can be used beyond the context of admin panels (like building entire apps with it).
- It’s more frequently updated by the main contributors and the open source Laravel community.
- Every member of Filament’s team is genuinely nice. My feeling over the last years in the paid Laravel ecosystem is that unless one of their employees gets in touch with you, the interaction is far from being pleasant.
- The fact that Laravel Nova is an official project doesn't really change anything. It's more of a marketing argument that you leverage when you are selling something.

## Pricing: Laravel Nova VS Filament

Comparing the pricing of a commercial project to an open source project is not really fair. But still, this article is here to give you all the information.

|   | Single project license | Unlimited projects license |
| - | - | - |
| Laravel Nova | $99/year | $299/year |
| Filament | $0 forever | $0 forever |

## Which one is simpler? Laravel Nova or Filament?

**Without hesitation, the simplest one is Laravel Nova.** 

But the scope of Filament and its possibilites go way beyond Nova's. That makes maintaining simplicity an almost impossible goal. If you are a business customer, you will easily be able to handle the cost of Nova and it will give you an edge on the execution of your projects compared to Filament.

## Which field types are supported by Laravel Nova and Filament?

**Both Nova and Filament support tons of different fields.**

And both also have free third-party plugins that should cover almost all of your needs. There's even high quality paid ones.
