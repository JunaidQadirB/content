In the latest episode of [Syntax](https://syntax.fm), hosts Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski, are joined by a special guest, Feross Aboukhadijeh from [socket.dev](https://socket.dev). They delve into the critical question â€“ "Should you just `npm install` random code?" This insightful discussion uncovers the risks behind the NPM packages we often take for granted.

Feross shares the journey of creating Socket, which began nearly two years ago, and how it guides developers through the minefield of open-source packages. Disclosing the sobering reality that some packages could harbor malicious code designed to steal environment variables and API keys, Feross emphasizes the necessity for comprehensive security scanning.

He also recounts the compelling backstory of the event-stream incident, where a trusted package was hijacked to steal cryptocurrency, highlighting the stealthy nature of such attacks and the subsequent evolution of Socket's security platform.

You will find out about Socket's innovative approach to scrutinizing NPM packages, employing GPT, to catch around 400 malicious packages each week. The pair discuss the threat of "protestware," where packages contain unexpected code based on the user's location, and they touch on the intriguing contribution of fully AI-generated package summaries.

Lastly, Feross shares his stance on decentralized code repositories in the wake of nefarious activities on centralized platforms.
