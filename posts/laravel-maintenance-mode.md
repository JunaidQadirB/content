## Enabling maintenance mode

When it‚Äôs time to update your app or perform some maintenance, switching to maintenance mode is super handy. And yet, I always forget it exists. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The maintenance mode is like putting a "Be right back!" sign on your website. To get this going in Laravel, it's as simple as running a command:

```bash
php artisan down
```

What if you want to give users a heads up that the site will be back shortly? Just add a refresh option:

```bash
php artisan down --refresh=15
```
 
This will tell the user's browser to reload the page after 15 seconds, but keep in mind that not all browsers pay attention to the Retry-After header if you use:

```bash
php artisan down --retry=60
```

## Sneaking past maintenance mode

Now, here's a cool trick. You can bypass maintenance mode with a secret token. Create a token using:

```bash
php artisan down --secret="your-secret-token"
```

Visit your app‚Äôs URL with the token appended, and you‚Äôll get a bypass cookie. If you prefer Laravel to create a token for you:

```bash
php artisan down --with-secret
```

Just remember, keep that secret simple and URL-friendly.

## The early bird: Pre-rendering the maintenance view

Want to avoid errors when users hit your site mid-update? You can pre-render a maintenance view that shows up instantly:

```bash
php artisan down --render="errors::503"
```

This is served up before Laravel fully boots, so it's quick to the draw.

(Oh and by the way, if you forgot about it, the 503 HTTP code means "Service Unavailable.")

## Taking a different path: redirects during maintenance

Maybe you'd rather redirect users elsewhere while you tidy up. No problem:

```bash
php artisan down --redirect=/
```

This steers visitors to wherever you specify.

## Back to business: disabling maintenance mode

All done? Great, let‚Äôs bring your app back with:

```bash
php artisan up
```

And just like that, you‚Äôre live again!

## Tailoring the experience

You‚Äôre the boss when it comes to how your maintenance page looks. Set up your own template at `resources/views/errors/503.blade.php` and make it your own.

## What about queued jobs during maintenance mode?

Worry not; queued jobs are put on pause in maintenance mode. They'll pick up right where they left off once you're back in action.
